# TicTacToeAI

![Program UI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/images/game.png)

It's an AI program that is based on the minimax algorithm and plays Tic Tac Toe. One of my first AI program.
The UI is from [CS50 AI - Tic Tac Toe](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/).

## How to play

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three X's or O's in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends in a draw if all the cells are filled and no one has won.

To make a move, simply click on an empty cell on the grid. The AI will make its move immediately afterwards. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Getting started

```
https://github.com/MZaFaRM/TIC-TAC-TOE-AI.git
```
or download its [Zip file](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/TIC-TAC-TOE-AI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

#### Optional steps

```

```
source myenv/Scripts/activate
```
